# MCclone 
A voxel-based toy game engine

![example](/screenshots/example.png)

This project was started as a way of learning about game-engine architecture and 3D rendering. It 
features randomly generated 3D terrain generated with perlin noise (using the yocto-gl library),
and some simple movement and collision detection implemented with an ECS (entity-component-system) 
architecture.
